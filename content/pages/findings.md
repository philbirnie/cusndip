title: Findings
excerpt: |
    We identified six overarching categories that encompass our collective themes which are:

    1. Importance of Counterspaces
    2. Black Student Representation
    3. Role of Black Faculty and Staff
    4. Mental Health and Wellness
    5. White Cultural Competence, and
    6. Communicating the Value of the Black Ohio State Community.

    We also provide unique findings specific to the three populations of Black campus change students, Black males in 3rd and 4th year and Black students 4th year and beyond.

## Unified Themes

<ul>
<li>Importance of Counterspaces
<blockquote>Seek mentors seek out mentors and just live your life right and experience everything, go out and connect because there are so many people that are willing to work with us and willing to, you know, give us experiences.

</li>
<li>Black Student Representation</li>
<li>Roles of Black Faculty and Staff</li>
<li>Mental Health and Wellness</li>
<li>White Cultural Competence
<blockquote>I can tell you right now, most minority students do not - the ones I have talked to when I do talk to people about it, they don’t have much faith in it. And that’s because we never see anything done with our reports. It is literally like writing a paper that you should not get graded for.

<li>Communicating the Value of the Black OSU Community</li>
