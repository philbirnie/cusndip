title: Findings
excerpt: |
    We identified six overarching categories that encompass our collective themes which are:

    1. Importance of Counterspaces
    2. Black Student Representation
    3. Role of Black Faculty and Staff
    4. Mental Health and Wellness
    5. White Cultural Competence, and
    6. Communicating the Value of the Black Ohio State Community.

    We also provide unique findings specific to the three populations of Black campus change students, Black males in 3rd and 4th year and Black students 4th year and beyond.
