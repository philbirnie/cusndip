My personal and professional life experiences have influenced my worldview and biases. Personally, as a White cisgender woman, most of my identities are privileged. Being White has been a privilege as I have not suffered the oppression and racism that other identities have experienced (Jemal, Bussey, & Young, 2020). I have learned I fall into the category of Whiteness, a social construct where being White is the norm and People of Color are marginalized (Feagin, 2010; Crowley, 2019). Professionally, as a former faculty member at OSU, in a predominantly white division and profession, I need to be critically aware of my own preconceptions, biases, and personal experiences and how these had an affect on my research process and findings. For my study, I  chose to step outside of my comfort zone and focus on the success of Black students. Within my purposeful sampling I intentionally sought to recruit at least one Black student in the dental hygiene major as it is my area of expertise and personal involvement. With all participants I shared that I was a former faculty member at OSU and it was my hope and intent that sharing this information would create meaningful dialogue with the participants and learn from their stories.
