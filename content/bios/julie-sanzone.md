As a White cisgender woman working in the student affairs field, I feel a sense of responsibility to own my priviledge and critically identify ways to disrupt it. In my professional role I actively seek opportunities for development that make me uncomfortable. I believe this better positions me to challenge the white supremacy culture (Okun, 2013) that permeates higher education. An awareness of the power that accompanies my racial identity informed how I recruited participants, framed the purpose of the study, facilitated interviews and reported findings. I reflected on this throughout my preparation, data collection, and analysis. In addition, my role as an administrator who has witnessed the challenges students face in the campus change process required me to constantly evaluate my interpretations of the data to ensure it was the story of these participants I was telling. I can not experience OSU the same way students in this study did so my role is to believe their stories and advocate for changes that will create an environment more supportive of success for Black campus change students.
