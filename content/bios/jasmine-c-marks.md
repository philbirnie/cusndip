Even though I am a person that faces much oppression, I still hold power in many spaces and feel it is my duty to be an advocate. As such, I am a millennial-aged cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied Black woman who grew up in a lower socioeconomic background. In this particular study, I utilize my position as an “insider” and scholar-practitioner to aid Black male student persistence through the elevation of their voices. Additionally, I employed reflexive practices at each phase of the research process. Schwandt (2018) defines reflexivity in the methodological sense, as, “the process of critical self-reflection on one’s biases, theoretical predispositions, preferences, and so forth” (Schwandt, 2015, p. 268). Reflexively, I yearn to co-create a future of which those after me will be proud. I may not see these changes in my lifetime, but I will aid in providing the foundation for who and what is to come. Additionally, my critical lens and the value of counter-storytelling merged to produce a research predisposition to exploring the narratives of Black men in their 3rd-4th years and utilizing their stories to disrupt ingrained systems that impact their ability to thrive.
