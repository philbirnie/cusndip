---
This report serves as a collaborative and year-long culminating product presented to a workgroup of the University Innovation Alliance known as the Cross-University Support Network (CUSN) at the Ohio State University. The problem of practice, presented in January of 2020, focused on these three studies aiding in the increase of African American/Black student success with specific focus on persistence and retention. The three individual studies produced unified and distinctive findings for three populations of focus which include African American/Black campus change students, African American/Black males in the 3rd and 4th years, and African American/Black students from their 4th year and beyond.
