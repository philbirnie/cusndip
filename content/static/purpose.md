title: Purpose of the Report
---
This report serves as a collaborative and year-long culminating project presented to the UIA@OSU, a collaborative partner of the Cross-University Support Network (CUSN) at the Ohio State University. CUSN is a workgroup focused on the outcomes and experiences of Black and Latinx students entering the university. The problem of practice, presented in January of 2020, focused on these three studies aiding in the increase of African American/Black student success with a specific focus on persistence and retention. The three individual studies produced unified and distinctive findings for three populations of focus which include: African American/Black campus change students, African American/Black males in the 3rd and 4th years, and African American/Black students from their 4th year and beyond.
