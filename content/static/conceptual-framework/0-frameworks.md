Each of the three studies utilized either an asset-based or anti-deficit framework to specifically ensure that we would disrupt traditional approaches to research regarding Black student success.

<p class="barred--researcher-1">The first narrative-study utilized concepts from expectancy-value theory (Eccles et al., 1983), which when paired with narrative methods provides insight into the experiences and persistence of Black campus change students who transitioned from a regional campus to the Columbus campus at The Ohio State University.</p>

<p class="barred--researcher-2">The second utilized Tara Yosso’s (2005) community cultural wealth model, an asset-based framework, to understand and uplift the experiences of 3rd and 4th year Black males on the Columbus campus of the Ohio State University. Understanding the strategies Black males employ to persist can aid in tailoring or bolstering Black male-centered interventions.</p>

<p class="barred--researcher-3">The third utilized an anti-deficit achievement framework (Harper, 2010, 2012). This approach views the achievement of 4th and 5th year Black students by focusing on their strengths, promise, and potential and identifies positive experiences that contribute to Black students’ educational success.</p>
