## Conclusion

<blockquote class="text-color-white">I know like, um, like for first generation students and Black students, like, retention rate is, like, it’s not as high as, like, White students. So I always feel like that’s kind of something in the back of my head. Like, I don’t want to just be, like, a number, another number. You know, I want to make sure I actually, like, graduate.
