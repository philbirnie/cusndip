### Mental Health and Wellness for Black Students

* Increase educational opportunities about financial wellness beyond loans and paying for college
* Develop opportunities for students to engage with nuances around their Black identity (e.g., colorism, mental health stigma, intersections of race and other identities)
* Evaluate the use of embedded counselors and ensure awareness of mental health providers with shared identities
* Increase the number of Black mental health and wellness counselors and increase mental health services
* Train all mental health providers to be culturally responsive

<blockquote>Um, having a Black counselor for the first time, like, it was somebody who could resonate with me and like, also shared their experience [being Black in predominantly white spaces] and made me understand that, like, okay, youâ€™re not crazy for feeling this way.
