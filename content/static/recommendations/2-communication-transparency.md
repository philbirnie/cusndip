<blockquote>After you know the movements and things that have happened on campus, just being slow to action. And yeah, just adjusting to white students needs rather than Black students needs...And it's like in the middle because there are a lot of resources, but also know that there's a lot of progress that can be made to better the University’s relationship with Black male students.
