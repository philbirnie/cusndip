<blockquote>So that's a piece [poor experience with white counselor] that motivated me to become more this counselor, mentor, coach for others and kind of directed me to psychology, because I was like I never want to have, I'll never want somebody to have an experience like that, where they just feel so misunderstood. Like naw, naw, that ainâ€™t happening.
