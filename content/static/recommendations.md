excerpt: |
    We present four overarching categories that encompass our collective recommendations. The four sections are:

    1. Mental Health and Wellness for African American/Black Students
    2. Communication & Transparency
    3. Major or Career Path Selection Support, and
    4. Mentorship.

    We also provide unique recommendations specific to our populations of focus.
